Informations:
The Customballer Gunsmith will not change the Damage of the gun you replace.
All you guns will have the "steady aim" perk.
Categories that are not compatible with your selected gunparts will be automatically deactivated in Gunsmith.
If you choose a suppressor the sound will be automatically suppressed. But if you don´t choose a suppressor you can also select a suppressed sound for you gun.
Feel free to upload your own Customballer Mod generated with my Customballer Gunsmith only on Nexusmods but please add me as second mod author. Thanks :)
You are not allowed to modify and publish the Customballer Gunsmith.


What does the Customballer Gunsmith?:
This Powersehll GUI Tool just generating json modfiles for you and zip it into a real mod.
So you only need to import your self generated customballer mod with simple mod framework.
If you start the Customballer Gunsmith for the first time or after an update, the script files will be unblocked automatically and it will create the fastmode.flag File.
On a second start, it won´t unblocked the scripts again, because fastmode.flag exists.
If an update is available and you press "download", the latest version will be downloaded from GitHub and replaces you current gunsmith files in the same root folder.
