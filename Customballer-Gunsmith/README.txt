You are not allowed to modify and publish the Customballer Gunsmith.


What does the Customballer Gunsmith do?:
This Powersehll GUI Tool just generating json modfiles for you and zip it into a real mod.
So you only need to import your self generated customballer mod with simple mod framework.
If you start the Customballer Gunsmith for the first time or after an update, the script files will be unblocked automatically and it will create the fastmode.flag File.
On a second start, it won´t unblocked the scripts again, because fastmode.flag exists.
If an update is available and you press "download", the latest version will be downloaded from GitHub and replaces you current gunsmith files in the same root folder.
